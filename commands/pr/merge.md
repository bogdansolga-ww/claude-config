description: Merge PR with squash, combining commit messages for catchup context
---

## Description

Merges the current branch's PR with squash, combining all commit messages into a single optimized commit message designed for use with the `/catchup` command.

## Execution Steps

1. **Verify PR Status**
   - Run `git branch --show-current` to get current branch
   - Run `gh pr view --json number,title,state,mergeable` to check PR status
   - Abort if PR is not mergeable or doesn't exist

2. **Gather Commit History**
   - Run `git log master..HEAD --oneline` to see all commits
   - Run `git log master..HEAD --format="%s%n%b"` to get commit messages with bodies
   - Run `git diff master...HEAD --stat` to see files changed

3. **Detect PRD Phase**
   - Check if branch name contains phase reference (e.g., `phase2`, `phase-2`, `p2`)
   - Extract phase number if present (e.g., "Phase 2" from `feature/saltedge-phase2-connect-flow`)
   - Look for corresponding PRD files in `docs/plans/` for context

4. **Determine Prefix**
   - Analyze commit messages and changes to determine type:
     - `[dev]`: Large features, new functionality, long-running development, dependencies
     - `[fix]`: Bug fixes, corrections, error handling improvements
   - Default to `[dev]` for mixed or unclear changes

5. **Generate Optimized Commit Message**
   - Get PR title from `gh pr view --json title`
   - Create title using format: `[prefix] PR_TITLE (#PR_NUMBER)`
   - If phase detected, ensure PR title includes phase (e.g., "Feature Name Phase N - Description")
   - Keep total title length reasonable (aim for ~72 chars when possible)
   - Add a blank line
   - Add a structured body with:
     - **Phase** (if applicable): Reference to PRD phase
     - **Purpose**: One sentence explaining what and why
     - **Changes**: Bullet list of key changes (from commit messages)
     - **Files**: Group changed files by area/purpose
   - Format for maximum `/catchup` usefulness

6. **Execute Squash Merge**
   - Extract first line from commit message as subject
   - Use `gh pr merge --squash --subject "FIRST_LINE" --body "REST_OF_MESSAGE"`
   - Do NOT include co-author footer
   - Do NOT include "Generated with Claude Code" footer

7. **Cleanup**
   - Run `git checkout master`
   - Run `git pull`
   - Delete the merged branch (locally and remotely)
